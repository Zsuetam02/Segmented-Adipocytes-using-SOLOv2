# Segmented-Adipocytes-using-SOLOv2
Algorithm to tweak database and teach SOLOv2 network to detect and segement adipocytes in different tissues

%% Features:
- Cropping whole dataset (images and binary masks) to match model input
- Extracting vital pairs of images/masks
- Preparing dataset itself to be fed into a model
- Model training
- Model evaluation

%% Enviroment:
- Tweaked SOLOv2
- MATLAB

%% Authors:
- Mateusz Skrzypczyk


%% Author notes:
- Project is still work in progress
- Once i find suitable computing power to train it, i will submit fully trained model, for now, its poorly trained just to see if algorithm works, as well as the result
- "mainv3" is the file that ought to be run to complete whole algorithm
- "reworkDataSet" is the only other script (not a function) to crop images/masks to desired size, outside of "mainv3"
