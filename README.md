# Segmented-Adipocytes-using-SOLOv2
%%%% WORK IN PROGRESS %%%%
Running "mainv3" reads and orders images and binary masks of adipocytes from different tissues
Then tweaked SOLOv2 model is learning to detect and segment adipocytes from fed images.
Once project is done i'll submit trained model with ROI curve, however as i said for now it is still work in progress.

reworkDataSet is separate matlab script that tweaks all dataset images and masks to match input size of a model
